## Website Performance Optimization project

The goal of this project is to take a simple website that has low page speed rating and increase it to a 90/100 page speed rating.

The main strategy was to shorten the critical rendering path by <br>
1. Minifying and compressing resources (HTML,CSS, javascript)<br>
2. Removing the render blocking css and javscript<br>
3. Inlining CSS<br>
4. HTTP caching<br>
