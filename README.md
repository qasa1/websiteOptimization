## Website Performance Optimization project

The goal of this project is to take a simple website that has low page speed rating and increase it to a 90/100 page speed rating.

The main strategy was to shorten the critical rendering path by
1. Minifying and compressing resources (HTML,CSS, javascript)
2. Removing the render blocking css and javscript
3. Inlining CSS
4. HTTP caching
